## Setup Xverse Wallet
1. Download and install the Xverse wallet from the [official website](https://xverse.app/).
2. Create a new wallet or import an existing one.
3. Make sure to use Native SegWit address, as Nested SegWits are currently not supported at the Midl Regtest infra.
4. Configure the wallet to connect to the Midl Regtest network: 
 4.1 Visit [swap.midl.xyz](https://swap.midl.xyz) and click on "Connect Wallet". Regtest network should automatically get added into your wallet configuration.

## Prizes
The hackathon features a total prize pool of $5,000 USD, awarded in USDC. The pool is split between two tracks, with one winning team per track. Prizes will be given to the teams that deliver the best solutions based on the judging criteria outlined in the track rules. All payouts will be made in USDC within 30 days after the hackathon.
