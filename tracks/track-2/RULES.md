# Track 2: Rune-powered Midl x Xverse Solidity dApp

## Use Case
This track is about building decentralized applications that connect Solidity-based smart contracts with the Bitcoin ecosystem.  

Teams must create a dApp that:
- Runs on **Bitcoin regtest**
- Uses **Midl infrastructure** and **midl-js**
- Integrates the **Xverse wallet** for connection and transaction signing
- Leverages **Runes** where possible  

There are no restrictions on the dApp idea itself — you are free to innovate. The only requirement is to use **Midl + Bitcoin regtest + Xverse Wallet + Runes**.

## Prize
One half of the total hackathon prize pool + perks from Midl and Xverse.

## Judging Criteria
- **Innovation & Use of Runes (25%)** – How creatively does the app leverage Runes?  
- **Integration with Midl.js & Xverse (25%)** – Smooth wallet connect, tx signing, infra integration.  
- **Functionality & UX (20%)** – Is the app working end-to-end? Is UX clear and intuitive?  
- **Real-World Impact & Use Case (15%)** – Does the app solve a real problem or open new possibilities?  
- **Presentation & Technical Clarity (15%)** – Was the solution explained and demoed effectively?  

## Rules
- Submission via GitHub Pull Request to the main hackathon repo into the track-2 directory  
- Deadline: **15:45 on August 27**.  
- Demo: **5 minutes + Q&A**.  
- Mentors available in the mentor area.  
- Must be used: React, TypeScript, Midl.js, Xverse Wallet, Satoshi-kit
